<h5>To create a page in your Flask application that consumes an API for finding addresses, you'll need to integrate an external API that provides address lookup functionality. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this:
Step 1: Choose an Address Lookup API
First, choose a suitable address lookup API. Some popular options include:
    • Google Maps Geocoding API: Provides powerful geocoding (address lookup), reverse geocoding (coordinates to address), and place autocomplete features.
    • OpenCage Geocoder: A straightforward and cost-effective geocoding service.
    • Mapbox Geocoding API: Offers geocoding and reverse geocoding services with customization options.
For this example, let's use the Google Maps Geocoding API.
Step 2: Set Up Your Flask Application
Ensure your Flask application is set up with the necessary dependencies. You might need to install requests library if it's not already installed (pip install requests).
Step 3: Create a Form to Accept User Input
Create a form in your template (address_lookup.html) where users can enter an address they want to search for.
address_lookup.html

Step 4: Create a Route to Consume the API
Create a route in app.py that handles the form submission and consumes the API to retrieve address coordinates.
app.py
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, url_for
import requests

app = Flask(__name__)

# Replace with your Google Maps Geocoding API key
API_KEY = 'your_google_maps_api_key'

Step 5: Replace your_google_maps_api_key
Replace 'your_google_maps_api_key' with your actual Google Maps Geocoding API key in app.py.
Step 6: Run Your Flask Application
Run your Flask application by navigating to the project directory and executing:
python app.py
Step 7: Access the Address Lookup Page
Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/address-lookup. You should see the address lookup form where you can enter an address and retrieve its coordinates.
